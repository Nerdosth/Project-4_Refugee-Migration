Project 4:

Team 00: 

Team Members:   Rahma Ali, Nicholas Erdos-Thayer, Chris Schultz,  Art Rogers


Project Proposal:

We plan to analyze state level data made available by the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR. In our analysis we hope to learn migration flows from other countries into the US and summarize the reasons on the migration and we hope to use machine learning to predict future refugee numbers.

 

Data Sources:

The UN Refugee Agency collects data on refugee’s around the world - https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/download/?url=Kg1Mg6
Uppsala Conflict Data Program - Department of Peace and Conflict Research - https://ucdp.uu.se/
